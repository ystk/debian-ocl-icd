Description: Generic OpenCL ICD Loader
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package contains an installable client driver loader (ICD Loader)
 library that can be used to load any (free or non-free) installable client
 driver (ICD) for OpenCL. It acts as a demultiplexer so several ICD can
 be installed and used together.

Description: OpenCL development files
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package provides the development files: headers and libraries.
 .
 It also ensures that the ocl-icd ICD loader is installed so its additionnal
 features (compared to the OpenCL norm) can be used: .pc file, avaibility to
 select an ICD without root privilege, etc.

Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files to build a ICD Loader
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package provides a header file that allows a OpenCL implementation
 to build a installable client driver (ICD). With a ICD, an OpenCL
 implementation can be used by any OpenCL program without the need
 to link the program to the specific OpenCL implementation.
 .
 For building OpenCL applications, installs the ocl-icd-opencl-dev package
 instead.

Description: Debug symbols for the generic OpenCL ICD Loader
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package contains detached debugging symbols for the OCL-ICD OpenCL
 library.
 .
 Most people will not need this package.
